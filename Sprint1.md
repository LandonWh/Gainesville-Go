User Stories:

Backend:
This sprint we planned to allow users to set up the events table, have a list of premade events to choose from, and rsvp to events. We were able to create the events table and set up get and post requests for it. We decided not to add all the potential elements to its schema this sprint so we can add them as the frontend is ready for them. We also decided to wait to make the premade events and allow users to rsvp till a later sprint. We also added the ability to create accounts, login, and get info about that account, which was intially planned for sprint 2.

Frontend:
This sprint we worked on setting up the base UI for our website. We made a login page, registration page, and implemented a navbar to navigate through the web application. The navbar has all the links and routing set up in order to go to each page in our website. In addition to this, we started to set up the create events page by implementing an interactive map of Gainesville using leaflet with popups for premade events.
