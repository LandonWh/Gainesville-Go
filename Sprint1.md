Backend:
This sprint we planned to allow users to set up the events table, have a list of premade events to choose from, and rsvp to events. We were able to create the events table and set up get and post requests for it. We decided not to add all the potential elements to its schema this sprint so we can add them as the frontend is ready for them. We also decided to wait to make the premade events and allow users to rsvp till a later sprint. We also added the ability to create accounts, login, and get info about that account, which was intially planned for sprint 2.

Frontend:
