"npm run start" in the client folder starts the client on localhost:4200/

"go run ." in the api folder starts the api on localhost 8080.
If you don't have go configured, you can use the executable here instead: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jr8vKzrJmk-uRhi0DbdDfydL3NM0YGEb/view?usp=share_link

Going to http://localhost:4200/api/ping should return a "Found me" message once both the back and front ends are running.
